# PWA Icons

This directory should contain PWA icons for the app.

Required icons:
- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

You can generate these icons using:
- Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Image editing software
- Design tools like Figma, Canva, etc.

The icons should represent the FonoaudiologIA app (speech therapy/microphone theme).

For now, placeholder files are created. Replace them with actual icon images before deploying.
